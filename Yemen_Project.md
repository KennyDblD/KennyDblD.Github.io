This project allowed me to explore data from the World Bank. I worked with CSVFiddle to run some SQL queries
and utilize the following functions:
<br /><br />
AS Function â€¢ GROUP BY Function â€¢ MIN and MAX Function â€¢ ORDER BY Function â€¢ LIMIT Function â€¢ AVG Function
<br /><br />
Below are the questions that I was tasked with answering:
<br /><br />
ðŸ’¡Which countries have the highest amount to repay?
<br /><br />
ðŸ’¡How many IDA loans are there currently?
<br /><br />
ðŸ’¡How many IDA loans are there per country?
<br /><br />
ðŸ’¡What is the maximum amount owed to the IDA?</p>
