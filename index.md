This project allowed me to explore data from the World Bank. I worked with CSVFiddle to run some SQL queries
and utilize the following functions:
<br /><br />
AS Function • GROUP BY Function • MIN and MAX Function • ORDER BY Function • LIMIT Function • AVG Function
<br /><br />
Below are the questions that I was tasked with answering:
<br /><br />
💡Which countries have the highest amount to repay?
<br /><br />
💡How many IDA loans are there currently?
<br /><br />
💡How many IDA loans are there per country?
<br /><br />
💡What is the maximum amount owed to the IDA?</p>

iFood is the Brazilian equivilant to Door Dash and I analyzed the data to gain insights into the customers that they serve.  I created bar charts, scatter plots and pivot tables.  The data revealed: <br>
The causal relationships between income and order amounts. <br>
How marital status and having kids at home affected spending. <br>
The months that had the highest number of new member acquisitions.

#### [Massachusetts Dept. of Education Tableau Project](https://www.loom.com/share/c79e0210b5394b15ab0984b0cc0bc984)

In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts education data. The main focuses were: <br>
What High Schools had the lowest graduation percentages? <br>
How does class size affect college admission? <br>
What are the top 4th grade math schools in the state?

[<img src="AirBnB_ZipCodes_Seattle.png?raw=true"/>](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kenny.dunn/viz/AirBnBZipCodeDataViz/Dashboard1)
In this case study I analyzed AirBnB data for the city of Seattle. There were three things that I was really focused on in analyzing this data and they were: <br>
Which Zipcodes have the highest prices for a rental? <br>
What months had the most revenue? <br>
Did the number of bedrooms in a rental affect rantability?
