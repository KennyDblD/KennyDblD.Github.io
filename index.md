<br><br>
In this project I explored NBA Player data from the 2023-24 regular season.  The data includes 572 rows and 30 columns, offering detailed statistics for 523 players. I utilized Tableau to create dashboards and a Tableau Story.
<br /><br />
I created Bubble Plots, Stacked Bar Charts, Heatmaps, and Tree Maps to display the data.

🏀 Luka Dončić and Nikola Jokić clearly dominate the offensive side of the game. <br>
🏀 Luka Dončić may be underrated as a defensive player but that side of the game is clearly dominated by centers with Victor Wembanyama being the clear top flight player here. <br>
🏀 PG’s and SG’s are the clear favorites in 3 PT% but a few teams have Centers that shoot the 3 well.<br> 
🏀 Most teams have at least two players that dominate the scoring on the team. <br>
🏀 PG’s dominate assists per team and position but there are outliers such as Nikola Jokić for Centers and Pascal Siakam for PF’s.

[<img src="images/Hospital_Pic.png?raw=true"/>](/Healthcare_Data_Project_Writeup.pdf)
<br><br>
This project allowed me to explore healthcare data from 130 hospitals across the U.S.  The data spans from 1999-2008 and included multiple tables within the dataset. I utilized MySQL to run SQL queries
and utilize the following functions to do that:
<br /><br />
GROUP BY Function • HAVING/DISTINCT Function • ORDER BY Function • COUNT Function • AVG Function •  CASE WHEN Functions • JOIN Function 
<br /><br />

💡Explored the Average length of stay in the hospital. <br>
💡Identifyed the medical specialties with the highest average procedure orders <br>
💡Investigated the correlation between the quantity of procedures administered to a patient and the duration of their hospital stay.<br> 
💡Investigated whether race influences the level of care received.

<br><br>
This project allowed me to explore IDA data from the World Bank.  I chose to focus my analysis on the Republic of Yemen. I utilized CSVFiddle to run SQL queries
and utilize the following functions to do that:
<br /><br />
AS Function • GROUP BY Function • MAX Function • ORDER BY Function • COUNT Function • AVG Function • AND/OR Functions • WHERE Function 
<br /><br />

[<img src="images/iFood.png?raw=true"/>](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/uncovering-flavorful-insights-data-analysis-ifood-trends-kenny-dunn-nkjqc/)
<br><br>
iFood is the Brazilian equivilant to Door Dash and I analyzed the data to gain insights into the customers that they serve.  I created bar charts, scatter plots and pivot tables.  The data revealed: 
<br><br>
💡The causal relationships between income and order amounts. <br>
💡How marital status and having kids at home affected spending. <br>
💡The months that had the highest number of new member acquisitions.

#### [Massachusetts Dept. of Education Tableau Project](https://www.loom.com/share/c79e0210b5394b15ab0984b0cc0bc984)
[<img src="images/Tableau_Mass_Ed.png?raw=true"/>](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kennyddunn_massachusetts-education-overview-activity-7163199462859870209-s2ZD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
<br><br>
In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts education data. The main focuses were: 
<br><br>
💡What High Schools had the lowest graduation percentages? <br>
💡How does class size affect college admission? <br>
💡What are the top 4th grade math schools in the state?

[<img src="AirBnB_ZipCodes_Seattle.png?raw=true"/>](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kenny.dunn/viz/AirBnBZipCodeDataViz/Dashboard1)
<br><br>
In this case study I analyzed AirBnB data for the city of Seattle. There were three things that I was really focused on in analyzing this data and they were: 
<br><br>
💡Which Zipcodes have the highest prices for a rental? <br>
💡What months had the most revenue? <br>
💡Did the number of bedrooms in a rental affect rantability?
