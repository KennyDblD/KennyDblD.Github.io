[<img src="images/Yemen_SQL_Code.png?raw=true"/>](/World_Bank_SQL_Project.pdf)
<br><br>
This project allowed me to explore IDA data from the World Bank.  I chose to focus my analysis on the Republic of Yemen. I utilized CSVFiddle to run SQL queries
and utilize the following functions to do that:
<br /><br />
AS Function â€¢ GROUP BY Function â€¢ MAX Function â€¢ ORDER BY Function â€¢ COUNT Function â€¢ AVG Function â€¢ AND/OR Functions â€¢ WHERE Function 
<br /><br />

ðŸ’¡What types of Programs are funded? <br>
ðŸ’¡What State Department borrowed the money? <br>
ðŸ’¡What State Department borrowed the money?.

#### [iFood Data Excel Project](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/uncovering-flavorful-insights-data-analysis-ifood-trends-kenny-dunn-nkjqc/)
[<img src="images/iFood.png?raw=true"/>](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/uncovering-flavorful-insights-data-analysis-ifood-trends-kenny-dunn-nkjqc/)
<br><br>
iFood is the Brazilian equivilant to Door Dash and I analyzed the data to gain insights into the customers that they serve.  I created bar charts, scatter plots and pivot tables.  The data revealed: 
<br><br>
ðŸ’¡The causal relationships between income and order amounts. <br>
ðŸ’¡How marital status and having kids at home affected spending. <br>
ðŸ’¡The months that had the highest number of new member acquisitions.

#### [Massachusetts Dept. of Education Tableau Project](https://www.loom.com/share/c79e0210b5394b15ab0984b0cc0bc984)
[<img src="images/Tableau_Mass_Ed.png?raw=true"/>](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kennyddunn_massachusetts-education-overview-activity-7163199462859870209-s2ZD?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
<br><br>
In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts education data. The main focuses were: 
<br><br>
ðŸ’¡What High Schools had the lowest graduation percentages? <br>
ðŸ’¡How does class size affect college admission? <br>
ðŸ’¡What are the top 4th grade math schools in the state?

[<img src="AirBnB_ZipCodes_Seattle.png?raw=true"/>](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kenny.dunn/viz/AirBnBZipCodeDataViz/Dashboard1)
<br><br>
In this case study I analyzed AirBnB data for the city of Seattle. There were three things that I was really focused on in analyzing this data and they were: 
<br><br>
ðŸ’¡Which Zipcodes have the highest prices for a rental? <br>
ðŸ’¡What months had the most revenue? <br>
ðŸ’¡Did the number of bedrooms in a rental affect rantability?
