iFood is the Brazilian equivilant to Door Dash and I analyzed their publicly available data to gain insights into the customers that they serve.  I created bar charts, scatter plots and pivot tables to reveal the causal relationships between income and order amounts, how marital status and having kids affected spending and what months had the highest numbers of new member acquisitions.

In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts education data. The main focuses were: <br>
What High Schools had the lowest graduation percentages? <br>
How does class size affect college admission? <br>
What are the top 4th grade math schools in the state?
